            <h4>JOLLOF RICE</h4>
            <h5>Ingredients</h5>
            <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion sliced</li>
            <li>5 Tbsp Tomato paste</li>
            <li>4 cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Ginger Grated</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves
            Blended pepper sauce see below</li>
            <li> 1 Tbsp Thyme</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Curry Powder</li>
            <li>1 Tsp Salt or add to taste</li>
            <li>White Pepper or black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp chicken bouillon powder or 3 cubes</li>
            <li>6 Cups Rice Long grain</li>
            <li>4 Cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 large tomato sliced</li>
            <li>1 medium onion sliced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter at room temperature optional</li>
            <li>For the sauce, blend together:</li>
            <li>3 Red Bell Pepper</li>
            <li>3 Tomatoes Plum</li>
            <li>2 Scotch bonnet</li>
            <li>1 Onion Diced</li>
            
        </ul>
            <p><h5>Instructions</h5>
            Heat the cooking oil in a large pan. When the oil is hot, add the diced onions and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes,
             or until the onions are soft.
            Next, add the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes. Then add the garlic, ginger, and bay leaves and let it 
            cook in the tomato paste for about 2 minutes.
            Add the blended pepper and allow the pepper to cook until the water is reduced entirely and the oil is seen 
            floating on the fried pepper—about 15 minutes.
            Season with thyme, curry powder, salt to taste, white pepper, and seasoning cubes. Cook for another 2 to 5 minutes.
            Stir the rice into the sauce until it is well coated. Then add the chicken stock, stir, and 
            cover with a tight-fitting lid, and then bring to a boil over high heat.
            Once it begins to boil—after about 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the heat immediately to medium-low and steam until the
             rice is done—about 30 minutes.

        <h4>PIZZA</h4>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>Cornmeal for baking sheet</li>
        <li>Flour for surface</li>
        <li>1 lb. pizza dough (thawed, if frozen)</li>
        <li>3/4 c. marinara sauce</li>
        <li>3 oz. mozzarella cheese, coarsely grated</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. grated parmesan</li>
        <li>Basil, for sprinkling</li>
        </ul>

 
       <p> <h4>Directions</h4>
        If you have one, place a pizza stone in the oven and heat oven to 500ºF 
        (if you can’t heat oven this high without broiling, set to 475ºF). Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal.
        On a lightly floured surface, shape pizza dough into a 14- to 16-in oval or 
        circle and place on prepared sheet (make sure that the dough slides easily around
        the sheet, if not, add a bit more cornmeal). 
        Spread sauce on dough, leaving a ½-in boarder all the way around and sprinkle with 
        mozzarella and then Parmesan. If using a stone, slide the pizza off the sheet onto the 
        stone. Bake until crust is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with basil just before serving, if desired.</p>

        <h4>BREAD</h4>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>Warm water: (105-115 degrees)- to activate the yeast.</li>
        <li>Active Dry yeast: Instant or rapid rise yeast can be substituted, following my adaption notes in the recipe card.</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar or honey: the sugar is used to “feed” the yeast and tenderize the bread.</li>
        <li>Salt: to enhance flavor</li>
        <li>Oil: Vegetable or canola oil, or melted butter could be substituted</li>
        <li>Flour: Bread Flour or All-Purpose Flour can both be used with no changes to the recipe.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <p>
            Proof the yeast: In a large bowl or stand mixer add the yeast, water and a pinch of 
            the sugar or honey. Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes until foaming and bubbly. 
            (This is called “proofing” the yeast, to make sure it is active. If it doesn’t
             foam, the yeast is no good, and you need to start over with fresh yeast).
            Prepare the dough: Add remaining sugar or honey, salt, oil, and 3 cups of flour.
             Mix to combine. Add another cup of flour and mix to combine. With the mixer running
              add more flour, ½ cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.
            Knead the dough: Mix the dough for 5 minutes on medium speed (or knead with your hands on 
            a lightly floured surface, for 5-8 minutes). The dough should be smooth and elastic, and slightly 
            stick to a clean finger, but not be overly sticky.
            First Rise: Grease a large bowl with oil or cooking spray and place the dough inside. Cover with a
             dish towel or plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place* until doubled in size (about 1 ½ hours).

            <h4>RAMEN</h4>
            <h5>Ingredients</h5>
            <ul>
            <li>2 chicken breasts (boneless, skin-on)</li>
            <li>kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper, to season</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp fresh garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>4 cups rich chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 oz dried shitake mushrooms (or 1/2 cup fresh)</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp sea salt, to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup scallions, sliced</li>
            <li>2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles</li>
            <li>optional: fresh jalapeño or chili slices, for serving</li>            
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.
            Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook
             until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over 
             and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
            
            Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the 
            oven, transfer the chicken to a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.
            MAKE THE RAMEN BROTH:
            Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a few
             minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.
            Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, then 
            add the dried mushrooms. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.
            MAKE THE SOFT-BOILED EGGS:
            Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the 
            fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk) or 8 minutes (for a soft, 
            but set-up yolk).
            Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the 
            cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell 
            and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.
            ASSEMBLE THE RAMEN BOWLS:
            Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the 
            eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.
            Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the 
            ramen broth. Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeño, and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately. Enjoy!!

        <li>Palm oil</li>
        <li>Spinach: any type of spinach can be used but I used baby spinach</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <p>Add ground melon to a bowl, add about a cup of water and mix to form a 
             paste then set aside. Wash and chop the spinach, drain in a colander and set aside.

            Place a big pan on medium heat, add palm oil and heat for about 3 minutes 
            (Do not bleach oil) add the reserved chopped onions and Sautee till translucent
            Add pepper mix, locust beans and stir to combine. Bring to boil for 5 minutes.
            Add the egusi paste in bits to pepper, reduce the heat, do not stir and cover the pot with a lid. Cook for another 10 minutes.
            
            
            
            Remove the lid, and gently stir the soup. The egusi would be lumpy at this point, use the
             back of a ladle to break the lumps it into desired size/texture
            Add smoked turkey, ground crayfish and crayfish, beef stock (if using) and stir to combine.
             Add bouillon cubes, taste and adjust accordingly. I didn’t add salt to this soup as the smoked 
             turkey and mackerel already contained salt. Continue to cook for another 10 minutes, check at 
             intervals and stir to avoid burning if need be
            Add shredded smoked mackerel and gently stir into the soup. Add chopped spinach, stir to combine and 
            cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. Take it off the heat, allow to cool for about 10 minutes before serving
            
            Serve and enjoy with any Nigerian swallow of choice

            <h4>FRIED RICE</h4>
            <h5>Ingredients</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups cooked rice</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
                <li>3 tbsp oil for frying</li>
                <li>1 cup onion diced</li>
                <li>1 cup mixed Vegetables Carrots, Sweet Peas, Sweet Corn and green beans</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp thyme</li>
                <li>1 tsp Curry powder</li>
                <li>1 chicken stock cube</li>
                <li>2 scallions diced</li>
                <li>1 cup beef liver cubed</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp Cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <p>
            Add the boiled rice to the stock in a medium pot and cook on medium heat until the water is dried up.
            Preheat the oil in a pan on medium to high heat, throw in the onions, and fry for a minute or two; add
             the scallions, mixed vegetables, thyme, curry powder, salt, and stock Cube.
            Throw in the beef liver and rice — Stir-fry for about 3 to 5 minutes on high heat.
            Take it off the heat and serve.
            Notes
            The white rice should be cooked tender but still firm to bite (like you cook your pasta al-dente).
             Overcooking the rice will result in mushy fried rice.
            Fried rice is best enjoyed when the Veggies remain crunchy, so don’t overcook your veggies.
            You need to increase the heat and stir continuously to get that nice coveted crisp during frying.

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <p>
            Trim off any excess fat from the meat. Rinse a couple of times till the water runs clear.
            Place the beef in a large pot. Add the diced onion, bay leaf, curry powder, rosemary, bouillon powder, 
            and salt. Mix well, cover, and leave to cook on medium heat for 10 minutes.
            Add the water stir and continue to cook on medium heat for another 20 minutes or until the meat becomes tender. 
            (Tougher meat cut will require a longer cooking time)
            When the meat is fully cooked use a sieve to separate the meat from the stock. Reserve the stock.
            Blend the tomatoes, onion, bell peppers, scotch bonnet peppers, garlic, tomato paste, and ginger, and set aside.
            In a large pot add the cooking oil on medium heat. Once the oil is hot but not smoking, add the diced onions and cook 
            for about 3 minutes.
            Add the blended pepper-tomato mixture stir, cover, and leave to cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes, occasionally 
            stirring to prevent burning.
            Stir in the beef stock, thyme, curry powder, and bouillon, and continue to cook for another 10 minutes on medium-low heat.
            Add the cooked beef, taste for salt, and adjust as needed. Cover and leave to simmer on low heat for another 5 minutes or 
            until the stew is thickened to your preference.
            Serve with white rice and fried plantains. Garnish with parsley if desired. Enjoy!
